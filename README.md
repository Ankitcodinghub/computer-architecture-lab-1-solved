Notes:

â€¢ Students are requested to submit the MIPS program(s)/source code (.asm files) to the BK Elearning system no later than the last lab session of your group. Assignments must be done individually.

â€¢ Students have to demonstrate program(s) on MARS MIPS during the last lab session. Students who do not show up during the demonstration time will get 0 for assignments.

â€¢ Similarity less than 30% in MIPS code is allowed. In other words, you will get 0 if your answers are similar to another studentâ€™s more than 30%. We will use the Stanford MOSS system to check the similarity (https://theory.stanford.edu/Ëœaiken/moss/).

â€¢ The report should not contain code. Instead, students should present the algorithms as well as the idea in your implementation.

Topic: Please design and write MIPS assembly language for implementing a text-based 5Ã—5 board Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players with following requirements.

1. During the first turn of both players, they are not allowed to choose the central point (row 3 &amp; column

3).

2. Any player who has 3 points in a row, column or diagonal will be the winner.

3. Players can undo 1 move before the opponent plays.

Rubric for evaluation

1. (2 points) Friendly interface

â€“ Students can design and implement an amicable user interface so that players can play easily without any confusion (2 points);

â€“ Students can design and implement a friendly user interface; however, players face some difficulty when playing the game (1.5 points);

â€“ Students can design and implement a user interface, but it is not friendly, or players need to do several steps for one move (1 point);

â€“ Student can design and implement a user interface, but it fails to allow playing (0.5 points)

2. (5 points) Application implementation

â€“ Students can implement an excellent application without any errors found (4.0 â€“ 5 points);

â€“ Students can implement a good application with some minor errors, but players do not need to restart the application to continue (3.0 â€“ 4.0 points);

â€“ Students can implement the application with some errors that prevent players from playing the game (2.0 â€“ 3.0 point);

â€“ Students cannot implement the application so that players can play/run (0 â€“ 2.0 points)

3. (3 points) Report

â€“ Students write such an excellent report that others can understand without any difficulty (3 points);

â€“ Students write a good report but quite simple or lack of information to understand (2.0 â€“ 3.5 points);

â€“ Students write a report with a lot of code embedded without any explanation (1.0 â€“ 2.0 points); â€“ Students write a simple report with most of the code attached (0.5 points)
